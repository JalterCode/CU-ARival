# 📌 CU ARrival – Augmented Reality Indoor Navigation for Carleton University

CU ARrival is an augmented reality mobile application built with Unity and Google ARCore that provides real-time, intuitive indoor navigation across Carleton University buildings. By scanning room plaques and using SLAM-based positioning, students can follow AR-guided paths to their classrooms, labs, and offices without getting lost.
